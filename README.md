# Chat-PDF
PDF Text Extractor and QA System

This repository contains a Streamlit application that extracts text from PDF documents, processes the text into manageable chunks, and leverages Google's Generative AI to provide question-answering capabilities. The project utilizes Langchain for text processing and FAISS for vector storage, integrating advanced AI embeddings to enhance the QA system.

# Features:

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload multiple PDF documents and extract their textual content.
  
- **Text Chunking**: Split the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
  
- **AI Embeddings**: Use Google Generative AI to generate embeddings for the text chunks.
  
- **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
  
- **Question-Answering**: Implement a QA system using Langchain's question-answering chain to respond to user queries based on 
    the extracted and processed text.

# Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating interactive web applications.

- **PyPDF2**: A library for reading PDF files and extracting text.

- **Langchain**: Used for text splitting and QA chain implementation.

- **Google Generative AI**: Provides embeddings and chat capabilities.

- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
